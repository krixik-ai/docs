    "Sequentially assembling multiple AI models into a single pipeline can be painful and expensive. Consuming even a single model can often be draining.\n",

    "That's why we're here. **Welcome to Krixik**, where you can easily assemble and serverlessly consume modular AI pipelines through secure Python APIs.\n",

    "## Quickstart Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "### Account Registration\n",
    "\n",
    "Krixik is currently in beta, so access to the Krixik CLI is by request only.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to participate as a beta tester, please complete [this brief Google form](https://forms.gle/RyBAvjN1HEWPScb67).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Krixik\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following command to [install](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/initialization/install_cli/) the Krixik Python CLI:\n",
    "\n",
    "```pip\n",
    "pip install krixik\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Python version 3.10 or higher is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialize your Session\n",
    "\n",
    "To [initialize](system/initialization/initialize_and_authenticate.md) your Krixik CLI session you will need your unique `api_key` and `api_url` secrets.  Beta testers will receive their secrets from Krixik admin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of handling your secrets directly, we strongly recommend storing them in an `.env` file and loading them via [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your secrets, [initialize](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/initialization/initialize_and_authenticate/) your session as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from krixik import krixik\n",
    "krixik.init(api_key=MY_API_KEY, \n",
    "            api_url=MY_API_URL)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...where  `MY_API_KEY` and `MY_API_URL` are your account secrets.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've misplaced your secrets, please reach out to us directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building your First Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "[Let's build a simple transcription pipeline consisting of a single `transcribe` module.](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/single_module_pipelines/single_transcribe/) We can [create](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/pipeline_creation/create_pipeline/) the pipeline with a single line of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create a simple transcription pipeline\n",
    "pipeline = krixik.create_pipeline(name='my_transcribe-pipeline-1', \n",
    "                                  module_chain=[\"transcribe\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline is ready! Now you can [process](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/parameters_processing_files_through_pipelines/process_method/) audio and video files through it to generate transcripts of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pipeline.process(local_file_path='./path/to/my/mp3/or/mp4')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs of [this pipeline](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/single_module_pipelines/single_transcribe/) will be a timestamped transcript of your input audio/video file, a `file_id` for the processed file, and a `request_id` for the process itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extending your Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "[Suppose you wanted to immediately perform vector search on `transcribe` module output.](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/search_pipeline_examples/multi_semantically_searchable_transcription/)\n",
    "\n",
    "You would need to do the following after transcription:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  *Transform* the transcript into a text file\n",
    "2.  *Parse* the text using a sliding window, chunking it into (possibly overlapping) snippets\n",
    "3.  *Embed* each snippet using an appropriate text embedder\n",
    "4.  *Store* the resulting vectors in a vector database\n",
    "5.  *Index* said database\n",
    "6.  *Enable* vector search on the database\n",
    "\n",
    "Locally creating and testing this sequence of steps would be time consuming—orchestrating them in a secure production service even more so. And that's without trying to make the entire process serverless.\n",
    "\n",
    "With **Krixik**, however, you can rapidly incorporate this functionality to your earlier pipeline by just adding a few modules. Syntax remains as above, so [making](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/pipeline_creation/create_pipeline/) the new pipeline still takes one line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# create pipeline with the above-alluded-to modules\n",
    "pipeline = krixik.create_pipeline(name='transcribe_vsearch', \n",
    "                                  module_chain=[\"transcribe\",\n",
    "                                                \"json-to-txt\",\n",
    "                                                \"parser\", \n",
    "                                                \"text-embedder\", \n",
    "                                                \"vector-db\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's [process](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/parameters_processing_files_through_pipelines/process_method/) a file through your new pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pipeline.process(local_file_path='./path/to/my/mp3/or/mp4')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that there is at least one file in [the pipeline](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/search_pipeline_examples/multi_semantically_searchable_transcription/), you can use the file's `file_id`—which was returned at the end of the above process—to perform semantic search on the associated transcript with [`.semantic_search`](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/search_methods/semantic_search_method/):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pipeline.semantic_search(query=\"The text you wish to semantically search for goes here\",\n",
    "                         file_ids=['the_file_id_from_above'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! You have now transcribed a file, processed the transcript, performed vector search on it, and can reuse [the pipeline](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/search_pipeline_examples/multi_semantically_searchable_transcription/) for as many files and queries as you like... all of it in a couple of minutes and with a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional: Pull the [Krixik Docs Repo](https://github.com/krixik-ai/krixik-docs)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to follow along with the above example, or with any other of the score of examples we lay out in the documentation, then simply pull the entire [Krixik Docs repo](https://github.com/krixik-ai/krixik-docs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing so will provide you with every file you need, and code will already be configured to run in that directory structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What can you build with Krixik?\n",
    "\n",
    "The [range of examples](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/pipeline_examples_overview/) we've documented for you include pipelines to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ...generate an image caption for a set of images and then perform keyword search on the caption set.\n",
    "  - [Pipeline: [Caption → JSON-to-TXT → Keyword Database]](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/search_pipeline_examples/multi_keyword_searchable_image_captions/)\n",
    "- ...transcribe a trove of documents, translate them to English, and then run sentiment analysis on each one.\n",
    "  - [Pipeline: [Transcribe → Translate → JSON-to-TXT → Parser → Sentiment Analysis]](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/multi_module_non_search_pipeline_examples/multi_sentiment_analysis_on_translated_transcription/)\n",
    "- ...easily and serverlessly consume your open-source OCR model of choice.\n",
    "  - [Pipeline: [OCR]](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/single_module_pipelines/single_ocr/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is only the tip of the iceberg—many more pipelines are currently possible ([see here for more examples](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/pipeline_examples_overview/))—and the Krixik module/model library will constantly be expanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Further Detail - Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is just a peek at the power of Krixik. In addition to all possible parameterization (which we didn't even touch on), the Krixik toolbox is an ever-growing collection of modules and models for you to build with.\n",
