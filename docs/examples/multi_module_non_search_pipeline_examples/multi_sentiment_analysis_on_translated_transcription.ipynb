    "- A [`transcribe`](../modules/ai_model_modules/transcribe_module.md) module.\n",

    "- A [`json-to-txt`](../modules/support_function_modules/json-to-txt_module.md) module.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A [`parser`](../modules/ai_model_modules/parser_module.md) module.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A [`sentiment`](../modules/ai_model_modules/sentiment_module.md) module.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the [`json-to-txt`](../modules/support_function_modules/json-to-txt_module.md) and [`parser`](../modules/ai_model_modules/parser_module.md) combination, which combines the transcribed snippets into one document and then splices it again, to make sure that any pauses in speech don't make for partial snippets that can confuse the [`sentiment`](../modules/ai_model_modules/sentiment_module.md) model.\n",
    "\n",
