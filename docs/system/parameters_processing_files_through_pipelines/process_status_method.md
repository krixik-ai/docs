## The `process_status` Method

The `process_status` method is available on every Krixik pipeline. It is invoked whenever you want to check the status of files being processed through a pipeline.

This method is especially useful when using the [`process`](process_method.md) method with `wait_for_process` set to `False`, for it gives you visibility into processes that have continued server-side after you regain control of your IDE.

This overview of the `process_status` method is divided into the following sections:

- [process_status Method Arguments](#process_status-method-arguments)
- [process_status Example](#process_status-example)
- [process_status Example with Deleted File](#process_status-example-with-deleted-file)

### `process_status` Method Arguments

The `process_status` method takes a single argument:

- `request_id`: (required, str) The unique ID associated with the relevant execution instance of the [`process`](process_method.md) method.

### `process_status` Example

Let's examine how the `process_status` method works when the [`process`](process_method.md) method succeeds. `wait_for_process` will be set to `False`.

First we'll need to create a pipeline. We can use a single-module pipeline with a [`keyword-db`](../../modules/database_modules/keyword-db_module.md) module for this example:


```python
# create a pipeline with a single parser module
pipeline = krixik.create_pipeline(name="process_status_method_1_keyword-db",
                                  module_chain=["keyword-db"])
```

Now we'll process a file through your pipeline. Let's use a text file holding Herman Melville's <u>Moby Dick</u>:


```python
# process text file through pipeline with wait_for_process on False
process_output = pipeline.process(local_file_path="../../../data/input/moby_dick_very_short.txt", # the initial local filepath where the input JSON file is stored
                                  local_save_directory="../../../data/output",  # the local directory that the output file will be saved to
                                  expire_time=60 * 30, # process data will be deleted from the Krixik system in 30 minutes
                                  wait_for_process=False, # do not wait for process to complete before returning IDE control to user
                                  verbose=False) # do not display process update printouts upon running code
```

What does immediate output for this process look like?


```python
# nicely print the output of this process
print(json.dumps(process_output, indent=2))
```

    {
      "file_id": "4a92698f-4e2e-4b88-9493-5080348e0153",
      "request_id": "25a281ed-0d04-909b-6b53-5148a298b3d1",
      "file_name": "krixik_generated_file_name_davuvkkxcu.txt",
      "symbolic_directory_path": "/etc",
      "file_tags": null,
      "file_description": null
    }


That's all you see because you retook control of the IDE as soon as the upload to Krixik was completed; the `process_output_1` variable doesn't know how the rest of the process went.

You can check the status of the process by feeding the `request_id` (returned when you called the [`process`](process_method.md) method) to the `process_status` method, as follows:


```python
# invoke process_status
process_1_status = pipeline.process_status(request_id=process_output["request_id"])

# nicely print the output our process_status call
print(json.dumps(process_1_status, indent=2))
```

    {
      "status_code": 200,
      "request_id": "7cdc9db9-5d5f-4bc6-b17e-73e0bd22440c",
      "file_id": "4a92698f-4e2e-4b88-9493-5080348e0153",
      "message": "SUCCESS: process_status found",
      "pipeline": "process_status_method_1_keyword-db",
      "process_status": {
        "module_1": false
      },
      "overall_status": "ongoing"
    }


Here you can see that your process has not yet finalized; its `overall_status` shows as `"ongoing"`.

If we wait a few moments and try again, you will see confirmation that the process completed successfully.


```python
# invoke process_status again
process_status_output = pipeline.process_status(request_id=process_output["request_id"])

# nicely print the output our process_status call again
print(json.dumps(process_status_output, indent=2))
```

    {
      "status_code": 200,
      "request_id": "05dd56e6-729c-4c9d-ba35-565543c8e1f5",
      "file_id": "4a92698f-4e2e-4b88-9493-5080348e0153",
      "message": "SUCCESS: process_status found",
      "pipeline": "process_status_method_1_keyword-db",
      "process_status": {
        "module_1": true
      },
      "overall_status": "complete"
    }


### `process_status` Example with Deleted File

As you have just observed, `process_status` on a failed [`process`](process_method.md) attempt shows us that the process failed.

What happens when the file `process_status` is run on [expires](process_method.md#core-process-method-arguments) or is manually [deleted](../file_system/delete_method.md) from the Krixik system?

We take deletion seriously at Krixikâ€”if a file is [deleted](../file_system/delete_method.md), it's entirely wiped from the system. Consequently, calling the `process_status` method on an [expired](process_method.md#core-process-method-arguments) or manually [deleted](../file_system/delete_method.md) file will tell you that the `request_id` you used as an argument was not found. The file is gone, as is any record of its having been processed in the first place.
