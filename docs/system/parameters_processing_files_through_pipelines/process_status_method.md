## The `.process_status` Method

The `.process_status` method is available on every Krixik pipeline. It is invoked whenever you want to check the status of files being processed through a pipeline.

This method is especially useful when using the [`.process`](process_method.md) method with `wait_for_process` set to `False`, for it gives you visibility into processes that have continued server-side after you regain control of your IDE.

This overview of the `.process_status` method is divided into the following sections:

- [.process_status Method Arguments](#.process_status-method-arguments)
- [.process_status Example](#.process_status-example)
- [.process_status Example with Deleted File](#.process_status-example-with-deleted-file)


```python
# import utilities
import sys 
import json
import importlib
sys.path.append('../../../')
reset = importlib.import_module("utilities.reset")
reset_pipeline = reset.reset_pipeline

# load secrets from a .env file using python-dotenv
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
load_dotenv("../../../.env")
MY_API_KEY = os.getenv('MY_API_KEY')
MY_API_URL = os.getenv('MY_API_URL')

# import krixik and initialize it with your personal secrets
from krixik import krixik
krixik.init(api_key = MY_API_KEY, 
            api_url = MY_API_URL)
```

    SUCCESS: You are now authenticated.


### `.process_status` Method Arguments

The `.process_status` method takes a single argument:

- `request_id`: (required, str) The unique ID associated with the relevant execution instance of the [`.process`](process_method.md) method.

### `.process_status` Example

Let's examine how the `.process_status` method works when the [`.process`](process_method.md) method succeeds. `wait_for_process` will be set to `False`.

First we'll need to create a pipeline. We can use a single-module pipeline with a [`keyword-db`](../../modules/database_modules/keyword-db_module.md) module for this example:


```python
# create a pipeline with a single parser module
pipeline = krixik.create_pipeline(name="process_status_method_1_keyword-db",
                                  module_chain=["keyword-db"])
```

Now we'll process a file through your pipeline. Let's use a text file holding Herman Melville's <u>Moby Dick</u>:


```python
# process text file through pipeline with wait_for_process on False
process_output = pipeline.process(local_file_path="../../../data/input/Moby Dick.txt", # the initial local filepath where the input JSON file is stored
                                  expire_time=60 * 30, # process data will be deleted from the Krixik system in 30 minutes
                                  wait_for_process=False, # do not wait for process to complete before returning IDE control to user
                                  verbose=False) # do not display process update printouts upon running code
```

What does immediate output for this process look like?


```python
# nicely print the output of this process
print(json.dumps(process_output, indent=2))
```

    {
      "file_id": "bc7f17d4-c3d8-49db-a482-1795d16da450",
      "request_id": "c4bdd067-4bc8-78b7-836b-80729a0d2950",
      "file_name": "krixik_generated_file_name_rgjvqsxgrz.txt",
      "symbolic_directory_path": "/etc",
      "file_tags": null,
      "file_description": null
    }


That's all you see because you retook control of the IDE as soon as the upload to Krixik was completed; the `process_output_1` variable doesn't know how the rest of the process went.

You can check the status of the process by feeding the `request_id` (returned when you called the [`.process`](process_method.md) method) to the `.process_status` method, as follows:


```python
# invoke .process_status
process_1_status = pipeline.process_status(request_id="c4bdd067-4bc8-78b7-836b-80729a0d2950")

# nicely print the output our .process_status call
print(json.dumps(process_1_status, indent=2))
```

    {
      "status_code": 200,
      "request_id": "1bd279bd-f5a0-4ddf-ad55-e48ede648c0a",
      "file_id": "bc7f17d4-c3d8-49db-a482-1795d16da450",
      "message": "SUCCESS: process_status found",
      "pipeline": "process_status_method_1_keyword-db",
      "process_status": {
        "module_1": false
      },
      "overall_status": "ongoing"
    }


Here you can see that your process has not yet finalized; its `overall_status` shows as `"ongoing"`.

If we wait a few moments and try again, you will see confirmation that the process completed successfully.


```python
# invoke .process_status again
process_status_output = pipeline.process_status(request_id="c4bdd067-4bc8-78b7-836b-80729a0d2950")

# nicely print the output our .process_status call again
print(json.dumps(process_status_output, indent=2))
```

    {
      "status_code": 200,
      "request_id": "b68886fe-a690-4483-9388-b0484a79af77",
      "file_id": "bc7f17d4-c3d8-49db-a482-1795d16da450",
      "message": "SUCCESS: process_status found",
      "pipeline": "process_status_method_1_keyword-db",
      "process_status": {
        "module_1": true
      },
      "overall_status": "complete"
    }


### `.process_status` Example with Deleted File

As you have just observed, `.process_status` on a failed [`.process`](process_method.md) attempt shows us that the process failed.

What happens when the file `.process_status` is run on [expires](process_method.md#core-.process-method-arguments) or is manually [deleted](../file_system/delete_method.md) from the Krixik system?

We take deletion seriously at Krixikâ€”if a file is [deleted](../file_system/delete_method.md), it's entirely wiped from the system. Consequently, calling the `.process_status` method on an [expired](process_method.md#core-.process-method-arguments) or manually [deleted](../file_system/delete_method.md) file will tell you that the `request_id` you used as an argument was not found. The file is gone, as is any record of its having been processed in the first place.


```python
# delete all processed datapoints belonging to this pipeline
import time
time.sleep(30)
reset_pipeline(pipeline)
```
