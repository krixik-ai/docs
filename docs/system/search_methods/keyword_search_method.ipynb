    "Krixik's `.keyword_search` method enables keyword search on documents processed through certain pipelines. Keyword search is something internet users are long familiar with: a string of words is submitted as a query, and the search returns any and every instance of any of those words. Contrast this to [semantic search](../system/search_methods/semantic_search_method.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.keyword_search` method can only be used with pipelines ending with the [`keyword-db`](../modules/database_modules/keyword-db_module.md) module.\n",
    "\n",
    "This overview of the `.keyword_search` method is divided into the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [.keyword_search Method Arguments](#.keyword_search-method-arguments)\n",

    "### `.keyword_search` Method Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.keyword_search` method takes one required argument and at least one of several optional arguments. The required argument is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `query` (str) - A string that contains one or more keywords separated by spaces that will be individually searched for across the target document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional arguments are the same arguments that the [`.list`](../system/file_system/list_method.md) method takes—both metadata and timestamp bookends—so please take a moment to [review them here](../system/file_system/list_method.md). As with the [`.list`](../system/file_system/list_method.md) method, you can `.keyword_search` across several files at the same time because all metadata arguments are submitted to the `.keyword_search` method in list format. All optional argument elements are the same as for the [`.list`](../system/file_system/list_method.md) method, including the wildcard operator and the global root.\n",
    "\n",
    "If none of these optional arguments is present, the `.keyword_search` method will not work because there will be nothing to search through.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the [`.list`](../system/file_system/list_method.md) method, the `.keyword_search` method also accepts the optional `max_files` and `sort_order` arguments, though their function changes a bit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_files` specifies up to how many files should be searched through.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sort_order` here takes two possible values: 'ascending' and descending'. This determines what order searched-through files are returned in (in terms of their creation timestamp), but keyword results within each file are displayed in order of appearance. Default is 'descending'."
